Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. '' 5121 et seq.). Title VI of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to make grants for the purpose of providing a system of emergency preparedness for the protection of life and property in the United States from hazards and to vest responsibility for emergency preparedness jointly in the federal government and the states and their political subdivisions. The FY 2016 EMPG will provide federal funds to assist state, local, tribal and territorial emergency management agencies to obtain the resources required to support the National Preparedness Goal's (NPG's) (the Goal's) associated mission areas and core capabilities. The federal government, through the EMPG Program, provides necessary direction, coordination, and guidance, and provides necessary assistance, as authorized in this title to support a comprehensive all hazards emergency preparedness system. 

The Emergency Management Performance Grant Program is to support a comprehensive, all-hazard emergency preparedness system by building and sustaining the core capabilities contained in the National Preparedness Goal. Examples include: 

- Completing the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) process; 
- Strengthening a state or community's emergency management governance structures; 
- Updating and approving specific emergency plans; 
- Designing and conducting exercises that enable whole community stakeholders to examine and validate core capabilities and the plans needed to deliver them to the targets identified through the THIRA; 
- Targeting training and verifying identified capabilities;

ND and AFG are awarded and managed differently within the Grants Program Directorate (GPD) and should be treated with discretion.

The only measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.

AFG awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.

Grants guidance is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives, and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents and may be found online at www.fema.gov/grants.

openfema-23,IndividualAssistanceHousingRegistrantsLargeDisasters,Individual Assistance Housing Registrants - Large Disasters,"1.1. What is the data in the submission?

Individual Assistance is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who have sustained losses due to disasters.

Homeowners, renters, and business owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles, personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared disaster may apply for disaster assistance.

Disaster assistance may include grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses.

Disaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs, welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.

This dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA's IHP unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf

Individual data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within the dataset.

1.2. How is it generated?

The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA's Individual Assistance (IA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.

1.3. How can the data be used?

The data can be used to analyze FEMA's IA program response attributes. This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.

OpenFEMA customers can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.

Community groups in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective and equitable recovery.

Please note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.

openfema-11,HazardMitigationGrantProgramPropertyAcquisitions,Hazard Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions,"This dataset lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity

Acquisition or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information on HMGP please visit https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.

Missing values - In some cases the projects are closed and the data was simply not provided by the sub-grantee or the Grantee and/or entered into the HMGP system. It is likely available as part of the paper file which is considered the file of record.

This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. For example, when an applicant registers they enter their street and city address.  The system runs a check and suggests a county.  The applicant, if registering online can override that choice.  If they are registering via the call center the Human Services Specialist (HSS) representatives are instructed to ask (not offer) what county they live in.  So even though the system might suggest County A,  an applicant has the right to choose County B.

openfema-35,IpawsArchivedAlerts,IPAWS Archived Alerts,"The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation's alert and warning infrastructure that unifies the United States' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services. IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.
Organized and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state, local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the public using a range of national and local alerting systems.
This data set contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement, Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe. It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed. The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system. To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov.
The data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdf

This is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450 Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. The dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed. The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information. This happens only on rare occasions. 
Earlier messages may contain non-compliant geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions of the software check these coordinates for compliance. 
This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov. 
Note that the original IPAWS CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original format. If no such tool is available to you, online utilities exist, such as https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape that will decode the message. See the originalMessage field for additional details.

openfema-50,HazardMitigationPlanStatuses,Hazard Mitigation Plan Statuses,"The data found on this page comes from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program's Mitigation Planning Portal (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.
Hazard mitigation planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters. It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area. After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)

Hazard mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments to: 
<ul><li> Increase education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and vulnerabilities</li><li>Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments, organizations, businesses, and the public</li><li>Identify long-term strategies that seek to reduce risk</li><li>Align risk reduction with other state, tribal, territorial or local objectives</li><li>Identify implementation actions to focus resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities</li><li>Connect priorities to potential funding sources</li><li>Increase investment in mitigation actions</li></ul>

A FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance.

openfema-32,FimaNfipPolicies,FIMA NFIP Redacted Policies,"Congress passed the National Flood Insurance Act (NFIA), 42 U.S.C. 4001 in 1968, creating the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in order to reduce future flood losses through flood hazard identification, manage floodplain, and provide insurance protection. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA's Write Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA's fiduciary and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming, and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and processing insurance claims. 

The paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. 

This data set is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.

The NFIP Transactional Record Reporting Process (TRRP) Plan (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/manuals/jan_2015_consolidated_trrp.pdf) defines for the WYO companies how to report policy and claims information to the NFIP. The Flood Insurance Manual (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/home/manuals) establishes how policies should be rated and underwritten.

openfema-33,MissionAssignments,Mission Assignments,"1.1 What is the data in the submission?

Mission Assignment, as defined in the 44 Code of Federal Regulations, is a work order issued by FEMA to another Federal agency directing completion of a specified task and citing funding, other managerial controls, and guidance. 

Mission Assignments are essential and powerful tools for federal emergency management under the Stafford Act.  Mission Assignments are distinct because they allow for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources to support disaster needs.

1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?

FEMA issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.

When States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8 (c).

1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?

Mission Assignments are administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic forms within FEMA's financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor, statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work, or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing and reimbursement.

This data set contains information required as part of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information for stakeholders:
- State or Tribal Government
- Disaster Number
- Description of Disaster 
- Agency
- Request for Assistance
- Obligations/Estimate
- Date Obligated
- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government is responsible (the cost share)

For more information on Mission Assignments, the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov

1.4 How is the data generated?

The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments for FEMA's Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.

1.5 How can the data be used?

The data provides information regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response to Stafford Act incidents.  

Note: The disaster costs reflected are not actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial report and should not be considered an official federal report.

openfema-60,PublicAssistanceApplicantsProgramDeliveries,Public Assistance Applicants Program Deliveries,"The 'Public Assistance Applicants Program Deliveries' dataset includes data from the FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery model dataset differs from other dataset as it specifies what phase current grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused on only awarded Grants. 
Short description of the PA Phases: 
Phase I - Operational Planning: Identify applicants' disaster impacts and recovery priorities.
Phase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis: Capture and document all of the incident-related damages
Phase III - Scoping and Costing: Further develop PA grant projects for final processing.
Phase IV - Obligation: Obligate projects.

The establishment of the Grants Manager and Grant Portal as the processing system for all new PA grants has reduced the role of its predecessor, the Emergency Management Mission Integration Environment (EMMIE). When all remaining EMMIE functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future, EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system of record for obligations.
