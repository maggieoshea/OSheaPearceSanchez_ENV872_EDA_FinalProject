EDA Final Project: Spring 2022

This project looks at the funding for hazard mitigation in the United States through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. It focuses on grants for flooding hazards and looks at trends in the number of properties as well as total amount paid over time, as well as how this compares to in-situ vs. ex-situ grants. The data set is an open access dataset downloaded from the Federal Emergency Management Agencies (FEMA) site OpenFEMA.
